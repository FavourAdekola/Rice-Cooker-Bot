## Music Player

### About:

The Rice Cooker music player is a work-in-progress function that will enable the user to play music from a series of streaming/video libraries (Just Youtube for now) in a discord server VC. Rice Cooker has functions to play, add to queue, skip, and clear queue based on User Inputs. 

### Play and Playlists
RiceCooker can take public/unlisted YouTube playlists or singular songs, download them locally, and spit the resulting download back through the VC, maintaining the sound quality of the original video(s).

### Queue
Rice Cooker allows a near-infinite number of items to be queued into the music player. The queue can be viewed and edited to some extent, such as shuffling and removing items from the queue.
